# event-driven-architecture-workshop

## Objectives
- Practice working with AWS cli
- Setup AWS resources
- work with EventBridge events and buses https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/events/home?region=us-east-1#/eventbus
- work with SES 
- work with Lambda https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions
- create a Pub/Sub pattern
- work with CDK
- work with CloudFormation
- trace events

## Exercise: 

You will create a Mini Applicant Tracking System (ATS) using an event-driven architecture in AWS. You will need to handle the following steps in a hiring pipeline: 

1. Send Assessment 
2. Schedule interview 
3. Send offer letter 

## Steps:

### 0. IAM Permissions:
#### Lambda Functions
- use an existing IAM role or create a new one that has SES sendEmail permissions (AmazonSESFullAccess).


### 1. Send Assessment 
This will be a lambda function that uses CDK to call SES to send an invitation link to the candidate. 

lambda function node20.x

[lambda code](/src/lambda/send-assessment.mjs)
``` json test payload
{
    toEmail: "email@criteriacorp.com",
    fromEmail:"email@criteriacorp.com",
    companyName: "Criteria Corp Testing"
}
```

### 2. Schedule Interview with idempotency 
This will be a lambda function that uses CDK to call SES to send a generic calendar invite. 

lambda function node20.x

[lambda code](/src/lambda/schedule-interview.mjs)


### 3. Send Offer Letter 
This will be a lambda function that sends the candidate an offer letter.


lambda function node20.x

[lambda code](/src/lambda/send-offer-letter.mjs)

### 4. Create Event Bridge Bus to route events to all the lambdas 
Create your own named bus so your events do not mix with other peopleâ€™s events. 
You will publish events on Event Bridge to emulate an API request. 



#### Notes and Tips: 
Review CloudWatch logs and enable X-Ray to trace events. 

### 5. Duplicate your AWS resources into a CloudFormation template to deploy the stack. 

 

### Bonus:  
Create a custom flow for Insight Partners by updating the event bus to direct events to a new lambda function for insights based on event filtering. 

Insight does not want candidates to receive emails. Instead, Insights wants to receive a list of names and event ids to hand out to candidates during their on-site testing event. 

### Bonus #2: 
Create a UI to trigger the different events in the ATS stages.
