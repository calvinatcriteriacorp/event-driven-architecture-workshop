- work with Lambda https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions
- create a Pub/Sub pattern
- work with CDK
- work with CloudFormation
- trace events

## Exercise: 

You will create a Mini Applicant Tracking System (ATS) using an event-driven architecture in AWS. You will need to handle the following steps in a hiring pipeline: 

1. Send Assessment 
2. Schedule interview 
3. Send offer letter 

Workflow diagram:

    EventBridge--> ScheduleAssessmentLambda
    EventBridge --> ScheduleInterviewLambda
    EventBridge --> SendOfferLambda 
```

## Steps:

### 0. IAM Permissions:
#### Lambda Functions
- use an existing IAM role or create a new one that has SES sendEmail permissions (AmazonSESFullAccess).
- we will use node 20.x runtime for these lambda functions


### 1. Send Assessment 
This will be a lambda function that uses CDK to call SES to send an invitation link to the candidate. 

[lambda code](/src/lambda/send-assessment.mjs)

lambda test payload:
``` json 
{
    "detail": {       
        "toEmail": "email@example.com",
        "fromEmail":"email@example.com",
        "companyName": "Example Corp"
    }
}
```

### 2. Schedule Interview with idempotency 
This will be a lambda function that uses CDK to call SES to send a generic calendar invite. 

[lambda code](/src/lambda/schedule-interview.mjs)


### 3. Send Offer Letter 
This will be a lambda function that sends the candidate an offer letter.

[lambda code](/src/lambda/send-offer-letter.mjs)

### 4. Create Event Bridge Bus to route events to all the lambdas 
Create your own named bus so your events do not mix with other peopleâ€™s events. 
You will publish events on Event Bridge to emulate an API request. 

### 5. Create Event Rule to route events to the appropriate lambda function on your bus.
- name your rule after the event type and use your event bus
- event pattern:
```json
{
  "detail-type": ["send-assessment"]
}
```
- target: your lambda function


#### Tip: 
- Review CloudWatch logs and enable X-Ray to trace events. 

### 6. Test your event-driven architecture by publishing events to your event bus.
- send the following event to your event bus
```json
{
  "source": "manual-test",
  "detail-type": "send-assessment",
  "detail": {
    "toEmail": "email@example.com",
    "fromEmail":"email@example.com"
  }
}
```
- check the lambda logs to see if the event was processed.

### 7.  Repeat step 5 and 6 for the other events.
- remember to change the "detail-type" in the event pattern and the target to the appropriate lambda function.

```json
{
  "source": "manual-test",
  "detail-type": "schedule-interview",
  "detail": {
    "toEmail": "email@example.com",
    "fromEmail":"email@example.com"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "source": "manual-test",
  "detail-type": "send-offer-letter",
  "detail": {
    "toEmail": "email@example.com",
    "fromEmail":"email@example.com"
  }
}
```


### 8. Duplicate your AWS resources into a CloudFormation template to deploy the stack. 
Use a cloudformation template to deploy your application.

Suggestion: start with 1 resource and incrementally add more resources to your template.

- Sample template for lambda: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-function.html

- starting template for CloudFormation: [start.yml](/cloudformation/start.yml)
- try to fill out the rest of the template on your own using AWS's docs and co-pilot, but if you get stuck, you can use the finished template for reference.
- finished template for CloudFormation: [finish.yml](/cloudformation/finish.yml)

#### cmd to validate cloudformation template
```bash
aws cloudformation validate-template \
--template-body file://./cloudformation/start.yml
```

#### cmd to create new stack
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
--template-body file://./cloudformation/start.yml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
--stack-name my-mini-ats-stack-workshop
```

#### cmd to create change set
- this creates a change set 
``` bash
aws cloudformation create-change-set \
--template-body file://./cloudformation/start.yml \
--change-set-name my-mini-ats-stack-workshop-changeset \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
--change-set-type UPDATE \
--stack-name my-mini-ats-stack-workshop
```

#### cmd to execute change set
```bash
aws cloudformation execute-change-set \
--change-set-name my-mini-ats-stack-workshop-changeset \
--stack-name my-mini-ats-stack-workshop
```

#### clean up/delete stack
- delete the cloudformation stack and resources associated to it
- go to AWS console: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home



### Bonus:  
Create a custom flow for Insight Partners by updating the event bus to direct events to a new lambda function for insights based on event filtering. 

Insight does not want candidates to receive emails. Instead, Insights wants to receive a list of names and event ids to hand out to candidates during their on-site testing event.

```mermaid
graph LR
    EventBridge--> Filter{Event Rule Filter}
    Filter-- detail-type: send-assessment, \n detail: isInsightCompany = false --> ScheduleAssessmentLambda
    Filter-- detail-type: send-assessment, \n detail: isInsightCompany = true --> ScheduleAssessmentForInsightCandidatesLambda
    Filter -- detail-type: schedule-interview --> ScheduleInterviewLambda
    Filter -- detail-type: send-offer-letter --> SendOfferLambda 
```

### Bonus #2: 
Create a UI to trigger the different events in the ATS stages.
